Table 1: A table titled "Summary of activities by day".  The column headers are the days of the week, Monday through Friday, and the row headers are the various activities.  Where the rows and columns intersect, there is an x placed in the square to indicate that the activity was done on a specified day. The x's are placed as follows: playing with wearables, watch challenges, and impossible game ball on Monday.  Impossible Game Ball, XYZ racing, and skills with wearables on Tuesday.  Wearable deconstruction, physical computing, and project ideation on Wednesday and Thursday.  Physical computing, project ideation, and tap the flag on Friday.

Figure 12: A pie chart showing the proportion of projects within each category.  7% health monitoring, 14% action automation, 22% progress tracking, 57% form awareness.
Figure 13: Form/technique awareness - Student-generated sketch of light up skate design.  The design page has the following notes: something that will beep if I did it right or wrong.  green means right red means wrong. change the size of the skate.  help me if I have troble skating and tie by it self.  proximity center.  ties (with arrows pointing to the tops of the skate drawing).  have to toch (with an arrow pointing to the blades).  turns yellow almost out of battery, red out of battery.
Figure 14: Progress tracking - student-generated sketch of waterproof watch to improve swimming.  The design page has the following notes: waterproff wactho.  if you help swiming you can get better.  there is also a drawing of a watch with the numbers "12:03", and a drawing of a person in water.
Figure 15: Action automation - student-generated sketch of watch that adjusts your arms if you are sinking while swimming on your back.  The design page has the following notes: when you need help floating on your back and your about to sinck the wacth beeps it ajustes your arm.  (There is also a drawing of a hand with colored nail polish wearing a watch.)
